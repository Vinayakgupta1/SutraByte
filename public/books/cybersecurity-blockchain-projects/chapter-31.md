### Chapter 31 — DevSecOps Sentinel

**Based on:** SIH1683 — DevSecOps Pipeline with Security Automation  
**Organization:** Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY)  

***

### Skills Required  
- DevOps & CI/CD pipelines (Jenkins, GitLab CI, Azure DevOps)  
- Security testing automation (SAST, DAST, SCA)  
- Infrastructure as Code (Terraform, Ansible)  
- Container security (Docker, Kubernetes)  
- Python and scripting for automation  
- Cloud platforms (AWS, Azure, GCP)  
- Incident response and monitoring  

***

### Project Description  
DevSecOps Sentinel is an automated security integration platform designed to embed security tools and workflows throughout the software delivery lifecycle. It orchestrates static and dynamic analysis, vulnerability scanning, and compliance checks into CI/CD pipelines, providing continuous security feedback to development teams. The platform supports container scanning, IaC validation, secret detection, and generates real-time alerts for policy violations. It also includes dashboards for metrics and compliance tracking.

***

### Tech Stack  
- Jenkins/GitLab CI/Azure DevOps for pipeline automation  
- SAST tools (SonarQube, Bandit) and DAST tools (OWASP ZAP)  
- Open-source SCA tools (Dependency-Check, Snyk)  
- Ansible, Terraform for IaC security checks  
- Docker Bench for container security auditing  
- Python for orchestration and API development  
- React/Angular frontend for dashboards

### Week-wise Roadmap  

**Week 1 — Setup and Pipeline Integration**  
- Set up CI/CD environment with pipeline definitions for build and test  
- Integrate SAST tools for code analysis in pipelines  
- Deliverable: Basic pipeline with SAST integration

**Week 2 — Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)**  
- Add OWASP ZAP scanning to pipelines for runtime analysis  
- Automate scan triggers, result collection, and failure criteria  
- Deliverable: Functional DAST integration with scan reports

**Week 3 — Software Composition Analysis (SCA)**  
- Integrate SCA tools to detect vulnerable dependencies and licenses  
- Automate SCA scans and integrate results into pipelines  
- Deliverable: Pipeline with SCA scanning and alerts

**Week 4 — Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Security Validation**  
- Implement IaC scanning for Terraform and Ansible scripts  
- Integrate enforcement gates in pipelines for IaC compliance  
- Deliverable: IaC security checks embedded in pipeline

**Week 5 — Container Security Auditing**  
- Integrate container image scanning using Docker Bench or similar  
- Automate image checks and policy enforcement before deployment  
- Deliverable: Container security auditing module

**Week 6 — Secrets Detection and Management**  
- Integrate secret scanning tools in pipelines  
- Develop automated response workflows for detected secrets  
- Deliverable: Secret detection pipeline stage

**Week 7 — Dashboard and Metrics**  
- Build dashboard visualizing security scan results, trends, and compliance metrics  
- Implement role-based access and alerting functions  
- Deliverable: Interactive metrics dashboard

**Week 8 — Testing, Documentation & Finalization**  
- Conduct end-to-end testing with sample projects  
- Prepare user manuals, API documentation, and deployment guides  
- Deliverable: Production-ready DevSecOps Sentinel platform

***

### Testing and Deliverables  
- Validate full pipeline with security stages on sample applications  
- Measure scan accuracy, latency, and failure response  
- Deliver source codes, configuration scripts, demo videos, and documentation

DevSecOps Sentinel enables development teams to deliver secure software faster through continuous integrated security automation and compliance enforcement.
