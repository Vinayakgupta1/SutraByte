### Chapter 3 — VulnXplorer  
**Based on:** SIH1684 — Agentless Vulnerability Scanner (NTRO)  
**Skills required:** Network pentesting, Nmap scripting, Burp Suite, OWASP ZAP, Kali Linux, Python  

***

#### Project Description  
VulnXplorer is a next-generation agentless penetration testing toolkit designed to perform comprehensive vulnerability assessments without requiring agents on target machines. It integrates network discovery, service fingerprinting, web application scanning, and CVE identification into a unified framework. The toolkit supports plugin-based extensibility for custom scans and is designed to generate detailed risk-prioritized reports with actionable remediation guidance.

***

#### Tech Stack & Tools  
- Python (core engine, plugins)  
- Nmap with NSE scripting (network scanning and fingerprinting)  
- Burp Suite/ZAP (web application security testing)  
- OpenVAS (vulnerability scanning)  
- Elasticsearch/SQLite (reporting backend)  
- Flask/FastAPI (API and web frontend)  
- Kali Linux environment (development and testing)  

***

#### Week-wise Roadmap (8 Weeks)

**Week 1 — Target Discovery & Network Scanning**  
- Setup Kali Linux dev environment with required tools.  
- Implement network discovery module using Nmap scanning techniques.  
- Develop Nmap NSE-based scripts for service and banner grabbing.  
- Deliverable: Initial asset discovery tool with host/service details.

**Week 2 — Service Fingerprinting & CVE Mapping**  
- Enhance service identification using banner analysis and protocol heuristics.  
- Build CVE mapping database linking identified services to known vulnerabilities (CPE/CVE data from NVD).  
- Deliverable: CVE lookup module connected to fingerprint results.

**Week 3 — Web Application Scanning Integration**  
- Integrate Burp Suite or OWASP ZAP APIs for automated web application scanning.  
- Develop crawler and spider modules for traversing target web applications.  
- Deliverable: Automated web application discovery and vulnerability reports.

**Week 4 — Plugin Architecture & Custom Checks**  
- Design and implement a plugin system for custom vulnerability checks.  
- Create userscriptable plugin examples for common exploits (SQLi, XSS).  
- Deliverable: Plugin manager and sample exploit detection plugins.

**Week 5 — Risk Scoring & Report Generation**  
- Develop risk scoring algorithm combining network and web scan results.  
- Implement report generator for exportable detailed PDF and JSON formats.  
- Deliverable: Risk-prioritized comprehensive vulnerability reports.

**Week 6 — Web API & Dashboard**  
- Build RESTful API exposing scan functions and results.  
- Develop React dashboard for managing scans, viewing live progress, and analyzing reports.  
- Deliverable: Functional dashboard with scan job controls and result views.

**Week 7 — Scheduling & Automation**  
- Implement scheduled and on-demand scan management.  
- Add notification and alert features via email/slack integrations.  
- Deliverable: Automated scan scheduler with alerting support.

**Week 8 — Final Testing & Documentation**  
- Run test scans against known vulnerable machines and applications.  
- Document installation, configuration, plugin creation, and user guides.  
- Deliverable: Final tested codebase, comprehensive user and developer documentation.

***

#### Testing and Deliverables  
- Set up test lab with vulnerable hosts (e.g., Metasploitable, OWASP Juice Shop).  
- Validate detection accuracy and false positive/negative rates.  
- Provide final deliverables: source code repository, demo VM snapshots, example reports, user manual, and a recorded demo walkthrough.
