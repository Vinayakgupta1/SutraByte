**Chapter 17 — MobileGuard**

**Based On:** SIH1747 — Improving Android Security for Android 14+

**Skills Required:**  
- Android application development  
- Mobile platform security  
- Static and dynamic analysis  
- Secure coding practices  
- Android security architecture (sandboxing, permissions, security APIs)  
- Python or Java for tooling

***

### Project Description  
MobileGuard is an advanced security suite designed to enhance the security posture of Android 14+ devices. It provides runtime protection, sandbox enhancements, permission management, and attack surface hardening. MobileGuard implements security policies that guard against privilege escalation, code injection, and unauthorized data access. It offers developers and administrators comprehensive tools for securing mobile ecosystems in compliance with the latest Android security best practices.

***

### Tech Stack  
- Android SDK and NDK for development  
- Java/Kotlin for app components  
- Python for static analysis and tooling  
- Android Security APIs  
- Android Debug Bridge (ADB) for device communication  
- SQLite or Realm for local data persistence  
- Integration with CI/CD pipelines for continuous security testing

### Week-wise Plan

**Week 1 — Environment Setup and Baseline Assessment**  
- Setup Android development environment (Android Studio, emulator, physical devices).  
- Study Android 14+ security features and available APIs.  
- Conduct security baseline assessments of target devices/apps.  
- Deliverable: Report on existing security posture and initial tooling setup.

**Week 2 — Runtime Protection Framework Development**  
- Develop app sandbox monitoring modules detecting anomalous behavior.  
- Build hooking frameworks for intercepting sensitive API calls.  
- Implement runtime checks for integrity and privilege escalation attempts.  
- Deliverable: Prototype runtime protection module.

**Week 3 — Permission Management Tools**  
- Design UI and backend for granular permission control and audit.  
- Integrate with Android’s permission model to intercept and log requests.  
- Implement alerting for high-risk permission usage.  
- Deliverable: Permission management dashboard prototype.

**Week 4 — Code Hardening and Injection Prevention**  
- Integrate techniques like code signing verification and control flow integrity (CFI).  
- Develop modules to detect and block code injection attempts.  
- Leverage Android’s SafetyNet and Play Integrity APIs.  
- Deliverable: Code integrity validation module.

**Week 5 — Security Policy Engine**  
- Create a policy definition framework for customizable security rules.  
- Implement enforcement mechanisms at the OS and app layers.  
- Support dynamic policy updates pushed from admin consoles.  
- Deliverable: Policy engine and admin API.

**Week 6 — Monitoring and Alerting System**  
- Develop event logging and anomaly detection modules based on runtime data.  
- Integrate notification services for real-time alerts.  
- Provide interfaces for forensic analysis.  
- Deliverable: Monitoring backend with alerting.

**Week 7 — Integration with CI/CD and Testing Automation**  
- Adapt MobileGuard scanning and monitoring into CI/CD pipelines.  
- Automate static and dynamic security testing of Android builds.  
- Establish feedback loops for dev teams.  
- Deliverable: CI/CD integration scripts and testing suite.

**Week 8 — Testing, Optimization, and Documentation**  
- Conduct comprehensive testing on emulators and physical devices.  
- Optimize for performance and battery usage.  
- Prepare detailed user and developer documentation.  
- Deliverable: Tested MobileGuard suite with complete docs.

### Testing & Deliverables  
- Use authorized test applications and devices for functional validation.  
- Measure detection accuracy, performance overhead, and usability impact.  
- Deliver source code, test cases, setup guides, and demo videos.
