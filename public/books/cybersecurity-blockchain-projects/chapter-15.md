### Chapter 15 — DataRecovery Pro

**Based on:** SIH1749 — Recovery of Deleted Data from XFS and Btrfs Filesystems (NCIIPC)

**Skills Required:**  
- Digital forensics  
- Filesystem internal structure (XFS, Btrfs)  
- Linux system internals  
- C and Python programming  
- Data recovery techniques  
- Low-level disk analysis and metadata parsing

***

### Project Description  
DataRecovery Pro is a forensic recovery tool designed to recover deleted and corrupted data specifically from modern Linux filesystems like XFS and Btrfs. It parses filesystem metadata structures such as B-trees, extent maps, and journals to reconstruct deleted files. The tool aims to support rapid and thorough recovery of forensic artifacts and user data for legal and incident response purposes.

***

### Tech Stack & Tools  
- C for low-level filesystem metadata parsing  
- Python for higher-level analysis and UI scripting  
- Libbtrfs/libxfs (if applicable) for interfacing with filesystems  
- Linux debugfs and ext tools  
- SQLite or NoSQL database for recovered file cataloging  
- CLI and optional simple GUI interface (Qt or Tkinter)

### Week-wise Roadmap (9 Weeks)

**Week 1 — Filesystem Study & Environment Setup**  
- Setup Linux forensic lab with disk images and test targets  
- Study XFS and Btrfs on-disk structures and metadata layouts  
- Setup dev environment with necessary libraries and tools  
- Deliverable: Documented specs and environment ready

**Week 2 — Metadata Parser for XFS**  
- Implement C code to parse XFS allocation groups, B-trees, and extent maps  
- Extract inode and directory information  
- Deliverable: Functional XFS metadata parser CLI tool

**Week 3 — Metadata Parser for Btrfs**  
- Build Btrfs metadata parsing modules (tree roots, extent references)  
- Support snapshots and subvolumes enumeration  
- Deliverable: Btrfs metadata parser with CLI interface

**Week 4 — Journal and Log Parsing**  
- Parse journaling data structures to recover recent file operations  
- Correlate journal entries with metadata for enhanced reconstruction  
- Deliverable: Extensible journaling parser module

**Week 5 — File Carving & Recovery Logic**  
- Implement algorithms for carving deleted files from free space extents  
- Rebuild partial file data using extent maps and snapshots  
- Deliverable: File recovery engine supporting partial and complete files

**Week 6 — Database and Cataloging**  
- Build recovery catalog to store recovered file metadata  
- Enable tagging, filtering, and searching of recovered files  
- Deliverable: Catalog database with queryable interface

**Week 7 — User Interface Design**  
- Develop CLI and basic GUI for operating the recovery toolkit  
- Support export of recovered files and reports  
- Deliverable: Usable interface for forensic analysts

**Week 8 — Testing & Validation**  
- Test recovery on sample forensic images with known deleted data  
- Measure recovery success rates and accuracy  
- Deliverable: Testing report and bug fixes

**Week 9 — Final Documentation & Packaging**  
- Write detailed developer and user documentation  
- Package complete toolkit with build scripts and installation guide  
- Prepare demonstration walkthrough video  
- Deliverable: Release-ready DataRecovery Pro toolkit

***

### Testing and Deliverables  
- Controlled tests with pre-deleted files on XFS/Btrfs images  
- Validation of recovery completeness and metadata accuracy  
- Final deliverables include source code repo, test datasets, user manuals, and demo videos
