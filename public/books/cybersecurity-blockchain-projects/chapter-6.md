**Chapter 6 — PentestX**

**Based on:** SIH1684 — Agentless Vulnerability Assessment (NTRO)

**Skills Required:** Vulnerability Assessment (VA), Penetration Testing (PT), Python scripting, Nmap, Metasploit, OpenVAS, Kali Linux basics

***

**Project Description:**

PentestX is an agentless vulnerability assessment toolkit focusing on offering rapid, scalable penetration testing and vulnerability management. The toolkit emphasizes modular design, enabling users to conduct network discovery, service enumeration, vulnerability checks, exploit verification, and reporting—all without installing agents on target systems. Its capabilities include automated scan orchestration, exploit validation, and centralized reporting.

***

**Tech Stack & Tools:**

- Python (scan orchestration, scripting modules)  
- Nmap (network discovery and service enumeration)  
- Metasploit Framework (exploit validation)  
- OpenVAS (vulnerability scan engine)  
- SQLite or Elasticsearch (vulnerability repository and reporting)  
- Docker (containerized deployment)  
- Kali Linux platform  

***

**Weekly Plan:**

**Week 1 — Environment Setup & Target Discovery**

- Set up Kali Linux and Docker development environment with essential tools.  
- Develop network discovery modules based on Nmap scanning techniques.  
- Implement service enumeration scripts using Nmap NSE and banner grabbing.  
- **Deliverable:** Network asset inventory module with host and service lists.

**Week 2 — Vulnerability Detection Integration**

- Integrate OpenVAS scanning capabilities via API.  
- Create vulnerability mapping by associating detected services to CVEs from the National Vulnerability Database.  
- Implement vulnerability scoring based on CVSS metrics.  
- **Deliverable:** Vulnerability detection engine with scoring and database backend.

**Week 3 — Exploit Validation Module**

- Integrate Metasploit for exploit execution against target services.  
- Design safe exploit validation workflows to confirm vulnerability existence without causing disruption.  
- Automate logging of successful exploit outcomes with contextual details.  
- **Deliverable:** Exploit validation module with testing scripts.

**Week 4 — Modular Plugin Architecture**

- Design and implement plugin architecture for adding new checks and exploitation modules.  
- Develop example plugins for common vulnerabilities (e.g., SMB, FTP exploits).  
- Provide API for plugin development and integration.  
- **Deliverable:** Functional plugin framework with sample plugins.

**Week 5 — Automation & Scheduling**

- Build scan orchestration engine supporting scheduled and ad hoc scans.  
- Allow asset grouping, scan policy assignment, and result aggregation.  
- Implement notification system for scan completion and critical vulnerability detection.  
- **Deliverable:** Scan scheduler and notification module.

**Week 6 — Reporting Module**

- Develop reporting system that consolidates scan and validation results.  
- Provide export functionality to PDF, CSV, and JSON formats.  
- Implement web-based dashboard for real-time results monitoring and risk prioritization.  
- **Deliverable:** Reporting engine with export and visualization UI.

**Week 7 — User Management & Access Control**

- Add role-based access control (RBAC) for multi-user environments.  
- Empower users to manage assets, schedule scans, and view reports per permissions.  
- Develop secure authentication module integrating LDAP/Active Directory.  
- **Deliverable:** User management module with secure login and permission model.

**Week 8 — Testing & Finalization**

- Conduct vulnerability detection accuracy tests on known targets (e.g., Metasploitable).  
- Perform exploit validation reliability assessments.  
- Load and stress test with large-scale scan simulations.  
- Prepare final documentation and user manuals.  
- **Deliverable:** Fully tested and documented PentestX platform ready for demonstration.

***

**Testing and Deliverables:**

- Demo deployment with real-world hosts and targets in a controlled lab.  
- Deliver source code, container images, sample scans, user guides, and demo video walkthroughs.
