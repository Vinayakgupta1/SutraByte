**Project Description:**  
AlgoDetect is an AI-powered system designed to automatically identify and classify algorithms implemented in software binaries or source code. It employs advanced feature extraction techniques from program characteristics, execution traces, or binary patterns, combined with machine learning models to detect known cryptographic, sorting, or compression algorithms. The tool assists security analysts and reverse engineers by accelerating algorithm recognition in unknown samples.
