### Chapter 11 — SecuScan

**Based on:** SIH1684 — Agentless Vulnerability Assessment (NTRO)  

**Skills Required:**  
- Network security fundamentals  
- Web application security testing (WAST)  
- Python programming  
- Full-stack development (backend API & frontend UI)  
- Database design and management (SQLite / Elasticsearch)  
- Basics of security automation  
- Kali Linux environment familiarity  

***

#### Project Description  
SecuScan is an integrated vulnerability scanning platform offering both network and web vulnerability assessment capabilities. Designed for scalability and ease of use, the system includes automated scan orchestration, dynamic reporting, and multi-user support. The platform emphasizes complete coverage of network services and web applications, remediations mapping, and risk prioritization to empower security teams with actionable insights.

***

#### Technical Stack  
- Python: scan orchestration, backend API (Flask/FastAPI)  
- JavaScript (React or Vue): frontend dashboard and visualization  
- SQLite / Elasticsearch: data storage and analysis  
- Nmap, OpenVAS: network vulnerability scanning  
- Burp Suite / OWASP ZAP APIs: web application scanning  
- Docker: containerized deployment environment  
- Kali Linux: development & testing OS  

***

#### Week-wise Plan

**Week 1 – Environment Setup & Basic Scanning**  
- Setup development environment (Linux/Kali, Docker containers).  
- Implement basic network scanner integrating Nmap and OpenVAS via API.  
- Design relational database schema to store scan results and host data.  
- Deliverable: working scanner prototype, database schema, and scanner data ingestion.

**Week 2 – Web Application Scanning Integration**  
- Integrate Burp Suite or OWASP ZAP scanner for web applications.  
- Develop crawler and input fuzzing modules for crawling authentication-protected web apps.  
- Implement API calls to scan initiation and result fetching.  
- Deliverable: web scan module integrated with network scanner.

**Week 3 – Scan Orchestration & Automation**  
- Build scheduler for recurring scans and ad hoc scan triggering.  
- Develop queue management and scan concurrency control.  
- Implement API endpoints for scan status and control.  
- Deliverable: scan job orchestration engine with API.

**Week 4 – Results Correlation & Prioritization**  
- Create engine to aggregate network and web scan results.  
- Implement risk scoring based on CVSS and exposure impact.  
- Enable historical trend analysis for continuous monitoring.  
- Deliverable: risk scoring and correlation module; risk trend visualization.

**Week 5 – User Management & Authentication**  
- Implement user registration, login, and role-based access control.  
- Develop frontend pages for user management and permission settings.  
- Secure API endpoints with token-based authentication (JWT/OAuth).  
- Deliverable: secure multi-user system with admin and user roles.

**Week 6 – Reporting & Dashboards**  
- Design detailed report formats (PDF, HTML) summarizing vulnerabilities and recommendations.  
- Develop interactive dashboards visualizing vulnerability heatmaps, scan coverage, and remediation status.  
- Enable report generation on-demand and scheduled distribution.  
- Deliverable: reporting module and dashboard UI.

**Week 7 – Notification & Integration**  
- Add notification system integrating email, Slack, or SMS alerts.  
- Build webhook support to integrate with SIEM or ticketing systems.  
- Automate escalations for critical vulnerabilities.  
- Deliverable: notification engine and integration adapters.

**Week 8 – Testing, Optimization & Documentation**  
- Conduct end-to-end functional and performance testing under simulated loads.  
- Optimize scanning pipelines, API latency, and UI responsiveness.  
- Complete developer and user documentation with setup guides and API reference.  
- Deliverable: tested production-ready SecuScan platform.

***

#### Testing & Deliverables

- Deploy SecuScan in a controlled test environment.  
- Validate accuracy of network and web scans against known vulnerable VMs.  
- Demonstrate user management and reporting capabilities.  
- Provide source code repository, containers, documentation, sample reports, and demo recordings.
