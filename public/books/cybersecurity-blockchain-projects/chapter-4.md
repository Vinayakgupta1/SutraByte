### Chapter 4 — CyberMentor  
**Based on:** SIH1697 / SIH1703 — Cybersecurity Learning and Awareness (converted problem)  
**Skills required:** Cybersecurity training, Education technology, AI/ML for education, Chatbots, Python, NLP basics  

***

#### Project Description  
CyberMentor is an AI-powered cybersecurity awareness and training bot designed to deliver interactive learning experiences. It simulates real-world attack scenarios, delivers curated educational content, quizzes users, and provides personalized learning paths to elevate cybersecurity skills. The chatbot supports multi-channel deployment including web, mobile, and messaging platforms.

- **Deliverable:** Content map and syllabus document.

**Week 2 — Chatbot Framework Setup & Basic Flows**  
- Set up chatbot framework backend and development environment.  
- Implement core conversational flows for greetings, content delivery, and quiz handling.  
- Prepare a webhook API that interfaces with the chatbot engine.  
- **Deliverable:** Basic chatbot prototype with static content flows.

**Week 3 — Dynamic Content & Personalized Learning Paths**  
- Integrate NLP for intent recognition and entity extraction.  
- Build models to assess user responses and adapt quiz difficulty.  
- Implement user authentication and progress tracking database schema.  
- **Deliverable:** Personalized learning module with user state management.

**Week 4 — Multi-Channel Integration and Frontend**  
- Develop and deploy a React or Vue frontend web interface.  
- Integrate chatbot with messaging platforms (Slack, Telegram).  
- Build dashboard for administrators to monitor learner progress and content usage.  
- **Deliverable:** Functional multi-channel chatbot with simple user interface.

**Week 5 — Quiz Engine & Gamification**  
- Develop dynamic quiz generation with feedback and scoring.  
- Add gamification elements like badges, levels, and leaderboards.  
- Improve chatbot's conversational abilities using pre-trained language models.  
- **Deliverable:** Engaging quiz system integrated into chatbot.

**Week 6 — Testing & User Feedback**  
- Conduct usability testing with representative users.  
- Collect and analyze feedback to refine flows, content, and UI/UX.  
- Address bugs, improve response accuracy, and enhance performance.  
- **Deliverable:** Tested and user-validated chatbot system.

**Week 7 — Documentation and Deployment**  
- Prepare user manuals and admin guides.  
- Containerize the application for easy deployment (Docker/Kubernetes).  
- Deploy on a cloud instance with monitoring set up.  
- **Deliverable:** Production-ready chatbot with deployment instructions.

**Week 8 — Advanced Features & Extensions (Optional)**  
- Add natural language generation for richer content delivery.  
- Integrate live instructor support or chatbot handoff.  
- Build analytics reports for deeper learning insights.  
- **Deliverable:** Enhanced chatbot with extended capabilities.
