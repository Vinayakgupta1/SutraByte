**Chapter 20 — LegacySecure**

**Based on:** SIH1727 — Secure Encryption Architecture for Legacy Systems  
**Organization:** Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs  
**Skills required:**  
- Cryptography fundamentals  
- Embedded systems development  
- System integration  
- C programming and scripting  
- Hardware security basics  
- Network protocols and IoT communication

### Project Description  
LegacySecure aims to retrofit modern cryptographic protections into legacy systems that lack inherent security features. It offers a universal encryption layer that can be integrated with existing hardware and software to encrypt communication, storage, and control commands without requiring major re-engineering. This approach enhances security for IoT devices, industrial control systems, and legacy infrastructure critical to urban services.

### Tech Stack & Tools  
- Embedded C for integration modules  
- OpenSSL or lightweight crypto libraries  
- MQTT, CoAP protocol implementations  
- Hardware simulators (Arduino, ESP8266/32)  
- Secure key management modules  
- Linux and RTOS environments for testing
