### Project Description  
ThreatMap AI is an AI-enabled cyber threat intelligence platform designed to visualize and analyze the attack surface dynamically. By correlating multiple threat intelligence feeds with organizational network data, it uses machine learning models to predict potential attack paths, identify vulnerable assets, and prioritize defense efforts. The platform features real-time dashboards, risk scoring, and integration with existing security tools.
