**Chapter 12 — RedOps**

**Based on:** SIH1684 — Agent-based Penetration Testing Toolkit (NTRO)  

**Skills Required:**  
- Red team operations  
- Offensive security techniques  
- Penetration testing methodologies  
- Scripting (Python, Bash)  
- C2 (Command and Control) frameworks  
- Payload development  
- Kali Linux environment  

***

### Project Description  
RedOps is a comprehensive offensive security toolkit designed to support red team operations with automation and advanced attack simulations. The platform integrates payload generation, command and control (C2) infrastructure, automated exploitation workflows, and reporting to streamline red team exercises. RedOps emphasizes modularity, stealth, and extensibility to mimic real-world adversary tactics while ensuring operational safety.

### Tech Stack  
- Python and Bash scripting for automation  
- Metasploit Framework for exploit management  
- Empire or Covenant for C2 infrastructure  
- Custom payload builders (e.g., msfvenom wrappers)  
- SQLite or Elasticsearch for session and task tracking  
- Docker/Kubernetes for deployment  
- Kali Linux for development and testing

### Week-wise Plan

**Week 1 — Setup and Reconnaissance Module**  
- Establish base dev environment (Kali + Docker containers).  
- Develop network and host reconnaissance modules (port scanning, service enumeration).  
- Automate target profiling and scanning pipeline.  
- Deliverable: Recon module generating target summaries.

**Week 2 — Payload Generation and Delivery**  
- Integrate Metasploit msfvenom for payload creation.  
- Automate delivery mechanisms (phishing, SMB relay, etc.).  
- Test non-destructive payload execution in lab environments.  
- Deliverable: Payload module with automation scripts.

**Week 3 — C2 Infrastructure Setup and Management**  
- Deploy Empire or Covenant C2 servers in containerized environments.  
- Build session management and persistence modules.  
- Implement secure command pipelines and logging.  
- Deliverable: Operational C2 server with client management.

**Week 4 — Automated Exploitation Workflows**  
- Orchestrate attack campaigns combining recon, exploitation, and post-exploitation.  
- Develop scheduling and dependency management engine.  
- Provide failover and fallback mechanisms.  
- Deliverable: Exploitation orchestration engine.

**Week 5 — Post-Exploitation Modules**  
- Include lateral movement scripts, credential dumping, privilege escalation modules.  
- Implement data exfiltration simulators and stealth techniques.  
- Deliverable: Comprehensive post-exploitation toolkit.

**Week 6 — Stealth and Detection Evasion**  
- Add obfuscation and encryption of payloads.  
- Integrate timing and beacon jittering in C2 communications.  
- Test evasion against common EDR/AV products.  
- Deliverable: Hardened stealth modules.

**Week 7 — Reporting and Analytics**  
- Build detailed red team operation reports with timelines and evidence chains.  
- Provide risk rating and exploit success metrics.  
- Deliverable: Reporting dashboard and export functions.

**Week 8 — Full-Scale Red Team Simulation**  
- Conduct end-to-end red team exercise in lab environment.  
- Monitor system detection and response; iterate on techniques.  
- Finalize documentation and user manuals.  
- Deliverable: Complete operational RedOps platform.

### Testing and Deliverables  
- Prepare test lab with vulnerable systems for safe exploitation.  
- Record success rates, stealth capabilities, and operational metrics.  
- Submit source code, user documentation, lab VM snapshots, instructional videos.
