### Chapter 30 — CloudGuard

**Based on:** SIH1682 — Data Security and Access Control for Hybrid Cloud Environments  
**Organization:** Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY)  

***

### Skills Required  
- Cloud computing fundamentals (AWS, Azure, GCP)  
- Hybrid cloud architecture  
- Identity and access management (IAM)  
- Data encryption at rest and in transit  
- Policy-based access control and RBAC  
- Python and cloud SDKs  
- Container orchestration (Kubernetes, Docker)  
- DevSecOps principles  

***

### Project Description  
CloudGuard is a comprehensive data security and access control platform for hybrid cloud environments. It enforces granular access policies across multi-cloud deployments, ensuring data confidentiality, integrity, and compliance. CloudGuard integrates encryption, authentication, and auditing mechanisms while providing a centralized dashboard for policy management and compliance reporting. It supports dynamic provisioning and revocation of access based on real-time risk scores.

### Tech Stack  
- Python backend with cloud SDKs for AWS/Azure/GCP  
- Kubernetes and Docker for deployment orchestration  
- HashiCorp Vault or AWS KMS for key management  
- OAuth2/OpenID Connect for authentication  
- Elasticsearch and Kibana for logging and monitoring  
- React or Angular for frontend UI

- Create access model aligning with RBAC and attribute-based access control (ABAC)  
- Deliverable: Architecture docs and system design

**Week 2 — Cloud Resource Discovery & Inventory**  
- Develop modules to discover and inventory cloud resources across providers  
- Integrate with cloud APIs for real-time resource metadata  
- Deliverable: Cloud asset inventory service

**Week 3 — Access Policy Engine Implementation**  
- Build policy definition and enforcement engine supporting dynamic rules  
- Implement role and attribute management modules  
- Deliverable: Policy engine with test rule sets

**Week 4 — Data Encryption & Key Management**  
- Integrate encryption libraries and services (AWS KMS, Vault)  
- Implement transparent data encryption and key lifecycle management  
- Deliverable: Encryption and key management modules

**Week 5 — Authentication & Authorization Services**  
- Develop centralized authentication service using OAuth2 / OpenID Connect  
- Integrate multi-factor authentication capabilities  
- Deliverable: Auth service with token issuance and validation

**Week 6 — Auditing, Monitoring & Reporting**  
- Implement logging of access events, policy violations, and system anomalies  
- Provide real-time monitoring dashboards and compliance reports  
- Deliverable: Auditing backend and visualization dashboard

**Week 7 — User Interface & Integration**  
- Build management console for administrators to define policies, review logs, and manage users  
- Enable APIs for integration with existing cloud and SIEM platforms  
- Deliverable: Fully functional UI and API endpoints

**Week 8 — Testing, Optimization & Documentation**  
- Perform security testing against attack scenarios (privilege escalation, data leaks)  
- Optimize system performance and scalability  
- Document system deployment, configuration, and user guides  
- Deliverable: Production-ready CloudGuard system with documentation
