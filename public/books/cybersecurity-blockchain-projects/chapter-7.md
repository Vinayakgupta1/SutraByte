**Chapter 7 — EcoTrack**

**Based on:** SIH1751 — Dashboard for Swachhta Monitoring

**Skills Required:** Frontend development (React, Bootstrap), Data Visualization, Backend API (Python/Node.js), Database basics, Geospatial data handling

***

### Project Description
EcoTrack is a smart cleanliness monitoring dashboard designed to visualize and track sanitation status across city sectors. It aggregates data from IoT sensors, citizen reports, and municipal cleaning schedules to provide real-time insights, historical trends, and actionable alerts to city officials and citizens. The dashboard integrates mapping, charts, and notifications to enhance urban hygiene management.

***

### Tech Stack & Tools
- ReactJS + Bootstrap for frontend UI
- Node.js or Python (Flask/FastAPI) for backend API
- PostgreSQL with PostGIS for geospatial data storage
- REST API for data ingestion
- Chart.js or D3.js for data visualization
- MQTT or HTTP clients for IoT data collection simulation

### Week-wise Roadmap

**Week 1 — Setup and Data Model**
- Set up development environment (React, Node/Python backend)
- Design and implement the data schema for city zones, sensor data, and cleaning activities
- Implement API skeleton with basic endpoints for data read/write
- Deliverable: Working backend API with database schema

**Week 2 — Frontend Layout and Static Dashboard**
- Create React app with Bootstrap template
- Design main dashboard layout with placeholders for maps, charts, and status boards
- Implement static views for city sectors and sanitation status
- Deliverable: Static dashboard UI with navigation

**Week 3 — Map Integration**
- Integrate OpenStreetMap or Google Maps into frontend
- Visualize city zones and sensor locations on interactive maps
- Add tooltips with sanitation status and cleaning history
- Deliverable: Interactive map component with dynamic data binding

**Week 4 — Real-time Data Simulation and Ingestion**
- Develop simulators for IoT sensor data streams reflecting cleanliness measurements
- Implement data ingestion pipeline via REST or MQTT into backend database
- Backend API updates to support real-time data fetching
- Deliverable: Live data streaming into dashboard with updated views

**Week 5 — Data Visualization Components**
- Implement charts and graphs (e.g., cleanliness trends over time, cleaning frequency)
- Enable filtering by zones, date ranges, and sensor types
- Add alert indicators for zones below threshold cleanliness
- Deliverable: Functional interactive charts and filter controls

**Week 6 — Notifications and Reporting**
- Implement notification system for municipal workers and citizens (email/SMS/web push)
- Generate scheduled and on-demand cleanliness reports (PDF, CSV)
- Deliverable: Notification module and report generation features

**Week 7 — User Management and Role-based Access**
- Design user roles (e.g., admin, municipal staff, citizen)
- Implement authentication and authorization flow in backend and frontend
- Delivery: Secure login and role-based dashboard views

**Week 8 — Testing, Optimization, and Documentation**
- Conduct usability and performance testing with sample datasets
- Optimize API performance and frontend responsiveness
- Prepare detailed user documentation and developer guides
- Delivery: Complete working EcoTrack system with documentation and demo video

***

### Testing and Deliverables
- Set up local/development server simulating full data flow
- Validate sensor data accuracy and dashboard responsiveness
- Deliver source code repo, data simulation scripts, test reports, and user documentation
- Record a presentation walkthrough of functionalities and admin dashboard

EcoTrack empowers urban authorities with actionable sanitation data via an intuitive dashboard, facilitating rapid response to hygiene issues and informed cleanliness management.
